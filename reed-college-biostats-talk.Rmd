# Hello!

.pull-left[

My name is **Monica Gerber**.

I graduated from Reed in 2011 with a degree in anthropology. I also studied a lot of Spanish, science, and even some math!

In 2015 I received a Master in Public Health (MPH) from Boston University. 

Now I am a biostatistician at Fred Hutch in the Statistical Center for HIV/AIDS Research and Prevention (S[CHARP](https://www.fredhutch.org/en/research/divisions/vaccine-infectious-disease-division/research/biostatistics-bioinformatics-and-epidemiology/statistical-center-for-hiv-aids-research-and-prevention.html)).

# What can I help you with?

`r emo::ji("question")` What exactly is biostatistics?

`r emo::ji("books")` What are grad school options for studying biostatistics?

`r emo::ji("graduation_cap")` What do I do with a degree in biostatistics? 

`r emo::ji("sun")` How do I gain exposure to this field? How do I know this is for me?

`r emo::ji("woman_technologist")` What's your job like?


*And if I don't know, I can help you find out.*

# What is biostatistics?

Wikipedia says:

> The development and application of statistical methods to a wide range of topics in biology.

... and medicine and public health. 

It's the tools and techniques for collecting data, then summarizing, analyzing, and interpreting results. 

Biostatisticians *may* be more interested in the data and subject matter, and statisticians *may* be more interested in mathematical theory.

???

Usually the objective is to make an inference about a population by studying a subset of that population.

HIV has a disproportionate impact on certain populations, especially among racial and ethnic minorities and gay and bisexual men. 

This is built on historical social injustices.

Also underlying is unequal access to healthcare.

# Biostaticians may specialize in:

`r emo::ji("gene")` **Genetics**: why are some people with a particular genetic mutation less susceptiple to HIV? 

`r emo::ji("microscope")` **Genomics**: how is the HIV virus evolving over time and place?

`r emo::ji("globe")` **Epidemiology**: what is the distribution of HIV? What are the causes of HIV acquisition? 

`r emo::ji("computer")` **Electronic health records**: how do we use EHRs and Medicaid/Medicare data to understand disparities in care?

Also: computational biology, neuroscience, clincial trial design, risk analysis, clinical decision making, environmental health, health policy.

### Some ideas for gaining exposure to biostatistics (and public health) careers as an undergrad

`r emo::ji("one")` Do some field work: `r emo::ji("phone")` Talk to people in the Reed alumni directory

* Keep it short (15-20 min)
* Ask them who else to talk to
* Keep a spreadsheet with everyone you've talked to
* Periodically update them!

This was *very* hard for me at first and I promise you will get better at it. Get help from the career office. Tell them what you're scared about and ask them for advice. 

> The people that you will talk to have had different experiences and grown up in different environments. What worked for them may not work for you.

### Some ideas for gaining exposure to biostatistics (and public health) careers as an undergrad

`r emo::ji("two")` Go to a conference or local meetup `r emo::ji("microphone")` `r emo::ji("woman_office_worker")` `r emo::ji("man_office_worker")`

* Lots of conferences have moved online this year
* Many have scholarships or are free

[R conferences](https://rviews.rstudio.com/2021/03/03/2021-r-conferences/): [Cascadia R Conf](https://cascadiarconf.com/), useR!, R/Medicine, R/Pharma

Data conferences: [csv,conf,v6](https://csvconf.com/)

Python conferences

Lots of stats conferences: JSM, find others through [American Statistical Association](https://www.amstat.org/asa/meetings/home.aspx) website.

### Some ideas for gaining exposure to biostatistics (and public health) careers as an undergrad

`r emo::ji("three")` Read journals `r emo::ji("books")` 

.pull-left[

Get the table of contents of a journal (don't pick too many) delivered via email and read the abstract for whatever catches your eye. 

Some ideas: New England Journal of Medicine, JAMA, The Lancet, Biostatistics, American Journal of Epidemiology, American Statistician.

### Some ideas for gaining exposure to biostatistics (and public health) careers as an undergrad

`r emo::ji("four")` Internships, volunteer work, and summer programs `r emo::ji("woman_mechanic")`

* Ask the career office for help. 
* Use the network you've built by talking to Reed alumni.
* Summer programs: Universities offer more specialized summer programs (and scholarships), for example the [UW Summer Institutes](https://www.biostat.washington.edu/summerinstitutes).

## Some advice

`r emo::ji("light_bulb")` Stacey Abrams on getting lost in possibilities: 

> I am a living example of the fact that there is no glory in having only one supreme goal. Too few books on achieving your dreams acknowledge that we are multifaceted beings with many different talents and interests. Society sometimes chides us to be focused on one goal, one passion, one ambition. It starts in college when we're told to pick a major.

On ambition: 

> Ambition means being proactive...[Do] something that moves you forward at a constant pace.
